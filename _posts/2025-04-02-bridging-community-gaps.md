title: Charting New Territories&#58; Strengthening Local Tech Communities Through Collaborative Action
---

It was on a crisp Tuesday in October 2017, that I first set foot on the university campus—a day that marked the beginning of an unexpected journey. Unlike many who followed a conventional path, my entrance was earned through a competitive exam, an experience that instilled both pride and a sense of trepidation. Stepping into a realm of diverse minds, I quickly realised that every new encounter was an opportunity to learn, yet also a reminder of how vast the world of knowledge truly is.

My early days were a mosaic of uplifting guidance and moments when inquisitiveness was met with condescension. The seniors, sometimes generous with their time and other times dismissive, embodied the dual nature of our community. It became evident that in every community, be it academic or professional, the spirit of inclusivity must be nurtured by those in positions of influence. I soon learned to seek support from those who encouraged my growth rather than those who inadvertently stifled it.

While my academic life was challenging enough, soon I found myself immersed in the local tech community of Fako, Cameroon—a space that promised camaraderie and innovation, yet was not without its struggles. At first, the buzz of the tech world was intoxicating. However, the realisation that not everyone was granted equal access to opportunities soon surfaced. Some events were cloistered behind an ‘insider’ mentality, with organisers inadvertently excluding those who did not fit a narrow definition of “tech”. As someone whose background was in chemistry and who had only recently dipped my toes into computing, I gravitated towards those who valued curiosity above credentials. This inclusivity became the cornerstone of my community involvement, enabling me to contribute despite my non-traditional background.

Our local group, though modest in its resources, has been a crucible of learning and experimentation. We organise low-cost practical training sessions, mentor one another, share job leads, and build networks that extend beyond the confines of any single event. Yet, like many grassroots initiatives, we struggle with systemic challenges: limited funding, fluctuating participation, and a lack of cohesive long-term strategy. Occasionally, well-intentioned meetings translate to mere discussions—a flurry of photo opportunities on social media, with little actionable outcome. It is clear that the vibrancy of our community relies on those few selfless individuals who do not just talk but act, transforming ideas into real opportunities.

This journey has offered me a unique perspective on the very elements that make a community thrive. I believe that leadership in the tech sphere should embody the spirit of service. Leaders must prioritise listening over dictating, and inclusivity over exclusivity. A community is only as strong as its ability to unite people of diverse backgrounds and nurture the latent potential within each individual. For us in Fako, this means actively dismantling elitist barriers and championing mentorship, practical training and genuine collaboration over hollow appearances at high-profile events.

In light of my experiences, I would recommend that Fedora look beyond the conventional metrics of success and direct its support towards addressing the tangible challenges faced by local communities. More than funding events, Fedora could:
 
1. **Provide Accessible Funding and Resources:** Seed grants or micro-funding initiatives can empower local community organisers to hold regular, low-cost training sessions and workshops. This investment would help break down the financial barriers that often hamper participation and innovation.
 
2. **Establish Mentorship and Networking Programmes:** By connecting experienced contributors with newcomers, Fedora could foster an environment of knowledge-sharing and career growth. A structured mentorship network would help pivot those from non-traditional backgrounds, such as myself, into thriving tech professionals.
 
3. **Encourage Action-Oriented Events:** Moving away from passive seminars and conferences, Fedora-supported events should focus on practical outcomes—be it collaborative projects, hackathons, or concrete community initiatives that culminate in measurable progress.
 
4. **Champion Inclusive Leadership Training:** Fedora could develop leadership programmes that emphasise servant leadership, ensuring that organisers both empower and are accountable to their communities. This training would help cultivate an environment where every question is valued and every member's potential is recognised.

Every challenge my community has faced has been met with resilience and a commitment to change. The future of our local tech community—and indeed the broader open source world—lies in harnessing this spirit of collaboration and in sharing the burdens of leadership. Together, with appropriate support from initiatives like Fedora’s, we can turn challenges into opportunities for collective growth.

In reflecting on this journey, I remain hopeful. The lessons learned—from being both uplifted and undermined—continue to shape my outlook on what a community should be: inclusive, action-driven, and steadfast in its commitment to serve. As we look ahead, I am excited about the possibility of a closer alliance between grassroots tech communities and global organisations like Fedora, where mutual support transforms isolated struggles into thriving opportunities for all.

Now, what further opportunities might exist within your own community? How can we continue to evolve our collaborative models to ensure that practical outcomes become the norm rather than the exception? These are the conversations that inspire me to keep pushing boundaries and seeking ways to make our tech communities more robust, accessible, and truly empowering.
