## 1\. Pre-Event Planning <a name="pre"></a>

### **1.1. Setting Goals and Objectives**

A successful event begins with clear, measurable objectives. Establish the primary purpose of your event—be it community engagement, technical knowledge exchange, workshop facilitation, or raising DEI awareness. Write a detailed objectives statement that outlines:

- **Primary Aims:** What does the event seek to achieve?
- **Measurable Outcomes:** Such as anticipated attendee numbers, diversity metrics of participants, and targeted satisfaction survey scores.
- **Success Indicators:** Criteria against which the success of the event will be measured.

This clarity will guide every subsequent decision and inspire all involved stakeholders.

### **1.2. Defining the Target Audience**

Delineate who your event is meant for. In the Fedora ecosystem, audiences may include:

- New contributors and long-standing members alike, including developers, documentation writers, designers, and community advocates.
- Specific groups such as Fedora Ambassadors and DEI advocates.

Ensure that you actively include underrepresented groups by tailoring invitations and outreach materials accordingly. Creating an attendee persona can help tailor the event content to meet varied needs.

### **1.3. Selecting the Event Format**

The choice of format plays a critical role in determining the logistics and design of your event:

- **Virtual Events:**
  - Choose platforms that offer interactive features such as breakout rooms, live polls, and built-in captioning.
  - Consider using tools like Pretix for attendee registrations.
  - Test the platform for accessibility, ensuring support for screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- **In-Person Events:**
  - Select venues that adhere to strict accessibility standards (e.g. wheelchair access, accessible restrooms, clearly marked exits).
  - Conduct a comprehensive venue assessment that includes registration areas, seating arrangements, equipment logistics, and contingency plans for unexpected issues.
- **Hybrid Events:**
  - Design technical setups to ensure that virtual and in-person participants can interact seamlessly.
  - Consider the challenges of synchronised streaming, and assign dedicated technical support to manage both environments.

### **1.4. Scheduling and Coordination**

Timing is crucial for maximum attendance and impact:

- **Avoiding Conflicts:** Consult the [Fedora Events Calendar](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/dei/events) to avoid scheduling conflicts with other community engagements.
- **Event Timing:** Choose dates and times that accommodate various time zones as Fedora is a global community.
- **Communication Channels:**
  - Create a dedicated event wiki page using the Fedora event template.
  - Publicise details on platforms like [Fedora Discussions](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/) and Fedora Community bulletin channels to attract a diverse audience.

A robust planning phase with intricate timelines, deadlines, and task assignments is vital.

## **2\. Speaker and Attendee Engagement**

### **2.1. Speaker Recruitment and Support**

Diversity in perspectives starts with inclusive speaker engagement:

- **Sourcing Speakers:**
  - Actively reach out to potential speakers from underrepresented communities.
  - Leverage out-reach on Fedora Discussions and within the broader Fedora Community channels.
- **Speaker Support:**
  - Provide clear guidelines on presentation requirements, emphasising the use of simple language, legible fonts, high contrast visuals, and accessible media elements (e.g. captioned videos).
  - Offer technical support, style guidance, and pre-event rehearsals to boost speaker confidence.
- **Mentorship:**
  - Develop mentorship programmes that pair first-time speakers with experienced presenters.
  - Encourage an environment of constructive feedback and support.

### **2.2. Crafting a Call for Proposals (CFP)**

A well-structured CFP is central to attracting a diverse pool of ideas:

- **Content of the CFP:**
  - Clearly outline submission guidelines, evaluation criteria, and deadlines.
  - Emphasise inclusivity by welcoming proposals that reflect varied cultural and technical perspectives.
- **Process:**
  - Use platforms such as Pretalx to manage submissions, which can streamline the review process.
  - Establish a diverse review panel to ensure that proposals are assessed fairly and that emerging voices are given an opportunity to shine.

### **2.3. Engaging and Preparing Attendees**

Ensure that your participants feel informed and valued:

- **Communication:**
  - Provide pre-event instructions, technical guidelines, and a schedule well in advance.
  - Supply event materials in multiple accessible formats (digital copies, transcripts, etc.).
- **Interactive Elements:**
  - Incorporate interactive sessions, Q&A segments, and live polls.
  - Create opportunities for networking and community discussions before, during, and after the event.

## **3\. Accessibility and Code of Conduct**

### **3.1. Ensuring Venue and Platform Accessibility**

Accessibility must be integrated into every aspect of event planning:

- **For In-Person Events:**
  - Verify that the venue complies with all accessibility requirements, such as wheelchair ramps, accessible restrooms, and adequate signage.
  - Pay attention to environmental factors (lighting, acoustics) to ensure that all participants can fully engage.
- **For Virtual Events:**
  - Select platforms that offer in-built accessibility tools (screen readers, live captioning).
  - Ensure that all digital event materials are prepared in accessible formats.
- **For Hybrid Events:**
  - Integrate both physical and virtual accessibility practices to ensure no attendee is disadvantaged.

Conduct accessibility audits and tests throughout the planning phase.

### **3.2. Implementing and Enforcing the Code of Conduct**

A robust Code of Conduct is essential for maintaining a respectful environment:

- **Preparation:**
  - Share Fedora’s official [Code of Conduct](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/code-of-conduct/) with all participants well before the event.
  - Inform speakers and volunteers about their responsibilities concerning respectful engagement.
- **Enforcement:**
  - Establish clear procedures and designate a point of contact to address any breaches of conduct.
  - Collaborate with the Fedora DEI team and the CoC Committee to manage violations swiftly and fairly.

This framework ensures that all participants can engage in discussions that are free of harassment and discrimination.

## **4\. Event Promotion and Community Engagement**

### **4.1. Marketing Strategies and Outreach**

Successful events attract participation through strategic promotion:

- **Campaign Planning:**
  - Develop a multi-channel marketing plan that includes scheduled posts on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn.
  - Engage with Fedora’s official communication channels, including the Fedora Community Blog.
- **Content Creation:**
