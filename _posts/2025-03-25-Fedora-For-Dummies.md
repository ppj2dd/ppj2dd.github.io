Hey beautiful person. First of all, you are not a dummy. [For Dummies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Dummies) is simply a term intended to present non-
intimidating guides for smart readers like yourself new to a topic covered. If you are here, you are a smart and beautiful person who wants to get some new 
(and updated) information on [The Fedora Project](https://fedoraproject.org/), or just refresh that bright mind of yours.


blog was built from a fork of [Barry Clark&apos;s Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repo.
