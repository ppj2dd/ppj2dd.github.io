## 1. Understanding Outreachy: More Than Just an Internship

Outreachy isn't your run-of-the-mill internship program. It's a vibrant initiative designed to support diversity in tech by providing paid, remote internships in open source and open science. Whether you're into coding, design, documentation, or community engagement, [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org) offers a plethora of projects to dive into.â€‹

## 2. Checking Eligibility: Are You on the Guest List?

Once you've selected a project:

- **Start Small**: Tackle beginner-friendly issues to build confidence and rapport with the community.â€‹
- **Seek Feedback**: Don't hesitate to ask questions and request reviews on your contributions.â€‹

## 7. Engaging with the Community: Building Bridges

Open source thrives on collaboration. To integrate seamlessly:

- **Join Communication Channels**: Subscribe to mailing lists, join Slack or IRC channels, and participate in forums.â€‹
- **Attend Meetings**: Be present in community calls or meetings to stay informed and connected.â€‹
- **Be Respectful**: Embrace the community's code of conduct and foster positive interactions.â€‹
