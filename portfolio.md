Good day Mentor(s), here you will find a portfolio of my contributions during the contribution phase. This link is not anywhere on the blog, so, for the world, all they will see is just that: the blog. 

I always looked forward to the green checkmark and words of encouragement from the Mentor after a task was completed. Those were the boosts I needed, and it feels kind of rewarding to receive (positive) feedback. 

Thanks a lot for your time to review my portfolio. Here goes:

## [Issue #1: Set up your Fedora Account System (FAS) account](https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/outreachy-internship/-/issues/1)
The steps were easy to follow, I ran into some challenges, but I realised that the solution was pretty simple: logout, refresh, clear cookies, refresh, and sign in again. Et voila. Picture appeared and my [account on Fedora Account System](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/user/ppj2dd/) was all set up.

## [Issue #2: Set Up a Personal Blog](https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/outreachy-internship/-/issues/2)
I chose Jekyll (with GitHub pages) because of the flexibility in customisation; and I get to learn how to write in Markdown. I thought about using what other applicants are using (WordPress, Medium, Hasnode, etc), but I did not believe I would have enough liberty to customise as I want. So, learned about using GitHub pages to host static blogs!

## [Issue #3: Write a blog post that introduces the Fedora community to your audience](https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/outreachy-internship/-/issues/3)
I tend to read a lot and do enjoy carrying out research. This post was challenging: it entailed a lot of reading and researching. I enjoyed writing this piece as it was an opportunity to not only create and produce consumable information, but also a chance to learn about what I was writing on.

## [Issue #4: Promote your intro blog post on social media](https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/outreachy-internship/-/issues/4)
Perhaps I will rack up more followers and/or be part of a bigger community one day. As someone who has always been working in the shadows, I realised through this contribution phase that for imapct to be made (and felt), we need to be intentional (and public) about it, even if it means getting out of one's comfort zone. And for me, that is getting online.

## [Issue #5: Write an onboarding guide for Outreachy applicants](https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/outreachy-internship/-/issues/5)
This piece has some personal experiences embedded in it. I wrote in two persons: as someone who has been there (an advisor if you would) and as someone who is yet to be there (a hopeful if you would). Nonetheless, I presented facts as facts: no biased opinions.

## [Issue #6: DEI Event Planning Guide](https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/outreachy-internship/-/issues/6)
Also research intensive, this guide is meant to enable anyone, _anywhere_ plan, organise, and execute an event in adherence with Diversity, Equity and Inclusion principles. The guide also enables event organise to understand what _was_ and _wasn't_ before, during and after their event.

## [Issue #8: Supporting Local Communities](https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/outreachy-internship/-/issues/8)
Entirely personal, this piece details my experiences (and involvement) with the very first \[tech\] community I encountered. The piece also includes some opinions and suggestions of what could be and could not have been in this community. This is a subjective piece and does not reflect the experiences of anyone else.

## [Issue #9:Plan a Fedora event at your university/community](https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/outreachy-internship/-/issues/9)
This is how I would go about organising a(n) \[Fedora\] event in my community, partnering with a selfless community organisation whose mission is to empower anyone with a drive by providing them with the resources, workspace, and support they need to thrive. Because they are dedicated to fostering a culture of creativity, continuous learning, and growth, I believe they are the best to partner with to execute a successful Fedora event.

## [Issue #10: Create a high level timeline for your Outreachy internship](https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/outreachy-internship/-/issues/10)
This is a timeline of activities I intend to carry out during the internship, including weekly calls/updates with the mentor(s) and (community) outreach and support.

## [An Event Flyer](https://github.com/ppj2dd/ppj2dd.github.io/blob/master/images/FedoraImmersionMonth.png)
The flyer above is my attempt at design. This flyer aims at publicising the event I will organise.
